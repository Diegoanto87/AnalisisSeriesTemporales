# Time series forecasting

Based in "A short course on forecasting" by Marcel Scharth, The University of Sydney

This the repository for the forecasting section of "Time series analysis", gradute course at the National University of CÃ³rdoba

This material draws on the [Forecasting Principles and Practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) textbook by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos. While the textbook and Rob Hyndman's [DataCamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/forecasting-using-r) use R, our tutorials provide a Python version of related content. 

This material also only relies in open source libraries.
